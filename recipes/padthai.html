    <p><em><strong>This amazing Pad Thai recipe is easy and comes together in under 30 minutes. It starts with fresh ingredients including rice noodles, chicken, shrimp, tofu, peanuts, scrambled eggs, and fresh vegetables all tossed together in a delicious homemade pad thai sauce.</strong></em></p>
    <p>I haven’t kept my love for Thai food a secret (here are some of my favorite Thai inspired recipes). My love comes from my mom’s cooking, and enjoying favorite Thai restaurants near my hometown, like My Thai, owned by Dee Benson. Dee also made the best fresh spring rolls and gave us advice for making them. This recipe was created by me in an effort to use ingredients I could find easily, and recreate the taste I love.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Pad Thai</h2>
    <p><strong>Cook Noodles:</strong> Follow package instructions to cook noodles just until tender.  Rinse under cold water.</p>
    <p><strong>Make Sauce:</strong> Stir together fish sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar (or tamarind paste), Sriracha, and peanut butter, if using. Set aside.</p>
    <p><strong>Sauté Protein:</strong> Heat 1½ tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, chicken or tofu, garlic and bell pepper. Cook until meat is done.</p>
    <p><strong>Cook Eggs:</strong> Push everything to the side of the pan. Add a little more oil and add the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs, breaking them into small pieces with a spatula as they cook.</p>
    <p><strong>Combine and Toss:</strong> Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts to the pan (reserving some peanuts for topping at the end). Toss everything to combine.</p>
    <p><strong>Serve:</strong> Top with green onions, extra peanuts, cilantro and lime wedges. Serve immediately!</p>
